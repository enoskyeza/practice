JS PRACTISE

1. Variable Declaration:
    Declare a variable called myVar and assign it the value 42.

2. Data Types:
    List three different data types in JavaScript.

3. Arrays:
    Create an array called fruits with three elements: "apple", "banana", and "orange".

4. Functions:
    Write a function named multiply that takes two parameters and returns their product.

5. Conditionals:
    Write an if statement that checks if a variable x is greater than 10. If true, log "x is greater than 10" to the console; otherwise, log "x is not greater than 10".

6. Loops:
    Use a for loop to log the numbers 1 to 5 to the console.

7. Objects:
    Create an object called person with properties name and age. Set the values to your name and age.

8. Array Manipulation:
    Add a new fruit, "grape", to the fruits array created earlier.

9. Function Parameters:
    Write a function named greet that takes a person's name as a parameter and returns a greeting message.

10. String Manipulation:
    Create a variable called sentence with the value "JavaScript is fun!". Use a string method to extract and log only the word "fun" to the console.

11. Objects and Methods:
    Add a method called getBirthYear to the person object. This method should return the current year minus the person's age.

12. Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises):
    Write a function called fetchData that returns a promise. The promise should resolve with the message "Data fetched successfully!" after a delay of 2 seconds.

13. Event Handling:
    Create an HTML button with an id of "myButton". Write JavaScript code to add an event listener to the button that logs "Button clicked!" to the console when the button is clicked.

14. Array Iteration:
    Create a function called sumArray that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

15. Objects and Methods:
    Create an object called calculator with methods add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Implement each method to perform the corresponding mathematical operation.

16. String Manipulation:
    Create a function called reverseString that takes a string as a parameter and returns the reversed version of the string.

17. Asynchronous JavaScript (Async/Await):
    Modify the fetchData function from the previous set of questions to use async/await.

18. DOM Manipulation:
    Create an HTML form with an input field and a submit button. Write JavaScript code to log the value entered in the input field to the console when the form is submitted.

19. Error Handling:
    Write a function called divideNumbers that takes two parameters and returns the result of dividing the first parameter by the second. Handle any potential division by zero errors.
